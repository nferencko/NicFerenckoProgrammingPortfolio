## BlackJack

With an assigned class partner, we designed and implemented a basic game of blackjack.  In our console application, a single user plays against a computer dealer.  In my role on this project, I wrote several classes using object-oriented design principles.  The classes I wrote for the project were the Card class (representing a single Card), the DeckOfCard class (a collection of Cards backed by an ArrayList), and the BlackJackHand class (another collection of cards representing a player’s hand).  Additionally, I helped my programming partner the driver for the program.  While the written program was fully functional, there were some elements of a typical BlackJack game that were left out (e.g. doubling down and splitting).  Additionally, some elements of the program need to be redesigned in order to make betting more robust so that that these additional features can be added.  In the future, I hope to work on this project for fun by implementing these features/redesign.
