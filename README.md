# Nic Ferencko Programming Portfolio

## BlackJack (Java)

- With an assigned class partner, we designed and implemented a basic game of blackjack.  In our console application, a single user plays against a computer dealer.
-  **My role on this project:** I wrote several classes using object-oriented design principles.  Specifically, the classes I wrote for the project were the [Card class](https://github.com/nferencko/NicFerenckoProgrammingPortfolio/blob/main/BlackJack/src/Card.java) (representing a single Card), the [DeckOfCards class](https://github.com/nferencko/NicFerenckoProgrammingPortfolio/blob/main/BlackJack/src/DeckOfCards.java) (a collection of Cards backed by an ArrayList), and the [BlackJackHand class](https://github.com/nferencko/NicFerenckoProgrammingPortfolio/blob/main/BlackJack/src/BlackJackHand.java) (another collection of cards representing a player’s hand).  Additionally, I helped my partner with some aspects of the [Actions class](https://github.com/nferencko/NicFerenckoProgrammingPortfolio/blob/main/BlackJack/src/Actions.java) (the program driver).
-  While the written program was fully functional, there were some elements of a typical BlackJack game that were left out (e.g. doubling down and splitting). Additionally, I am currently learning Java Swing and would like to create a GUI version of this program and element and also incorporate sound.

## Probability Simulator (Java)

- With three partners, I designed and wrote a program to run several different Monte Carlo probability simulations.  In this program, the user could choose from a menu of experiments (e.g. Monty Hall simulation, card simulations, or picking marbles from a bag ).  Then, the experiment would be run several times with the results recorded.  The program would output the experimental results along with the theoretical results for comparison.
- **My role on this project:** In this project, I wrote the main menu (driver) along with the card simulations.  In my card simulations, I was able to reuse many of the classes I had written for the BlackJack game. Specifically, the classes I wrote in this project were BlackJackHand.java, Card.java, CardMenu.java, CardSimulations.java, DeckOfCards.java, MainMenu.java, and PokerHand.java.

## a01-exponentialgrowth (C++)

- **Individual Project** One of my first C++ projects. In this project I learned how to use functions, grab user input, format output, and use exceptions in C++. I like to call this program an investment calculator. This console application prompts the user to enter investment information and outputs the value of their account over the specified time period. 

## a05-InBetweenHand (C++)

- **Individual Project:** A console application that allows a group of users to play the card game In Between Hand against each other and/or a group of AI players.  The design of the program was largely provided by the instructor, but it was left to me to write all the classes along with the game driver.  Completing the project required an understanding of inheritance and polymorphism along with the C++ STL.
